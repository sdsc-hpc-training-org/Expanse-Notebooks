    "# Prompting GPT using OpenAI API\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, is specifically tailored for generating human-like text, making it ideal for conversational interfaces and producing contextually relevant responses. This contrasts with the broader capabilities of the OpenAI API, which offers access to a variety of models for different tasks, including text generation, image creation, and language understanding. You might want to prompt GPT from a Python script or notebook for a more uniform and structured approach to your data analysis tasks. Integrating ChatGPT within a Python environment, as part of the broader OpenAI API suite, facilitates consistency and repeatability across different datasets and projects, streamlining the analytical process through automation and standardized interactions. While this method enhances efficiency and control, it's important to consider that it also introduces a level of rigidity. The reliance on predefined scripts can constrain the flexibility and spontaneity needed for certain ad-hoc explorations and creative insights. In this section of the tutorial, we'll delve into how to effectively integrate GPT within Python environments, balancing efficiency with the need for exploratory analysis."

Similarly, adjusting the `max_tokens` parameter allows you to control the length of the AI's responses. A higher token count can provide more detailed and expansive answers, while a lower count results in more concise responses. Experimenting with these settings can help you fine-tune the AI's output to better suit your specific requirements and understand the nuances of conversational AI dynamics."

    "### Understanding the Chat Completion Create Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The `create` method for chat completions in the OpenAI API is a powerful tool that allows you to interact with OpenAI's models conversationally. When you use this method, you're essentially starting a chat session with the AI, where you can submit prompts, and the model will generate responses based on the context provided by previous exchanges in the session. Here's what you need to know about the most relevant parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `model`:\n",
    "(required) Specifies the language model you wish to use for the chat completion. OpenAI offers various models with different capabilities and specialties—the following [blog](https://semaphoreci.com/blog/openai-models#a-few-thoughts-on-choosing-a-model) details how to choose the right model for your task.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `messages`: (required) A list of message objects that represent the conversation history. Each message object can be from the user or system, and contains the message content.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `system`: Allows you to provide initial instructions to the model. These instructions are used to set the behavior, tone, and/or constraints for the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. `assistant`: Represents the model's generated replies to the user's messages. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. `user`: Specifies the message from the human interacting with the model.  Also used to identify the user in multi-user scenarios, helping the model to personalize or distinguish between different participants in the chat.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `max_tokens`: Sets the maximum number of output/completion tokens (words and characters) the model will generate in each response. It is used to control cost and response length.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. `temperature`: Controls the randomness of the model's responses. A higher temperature results in more varied responses, while a lower temperature makes the model's responses more deterministic. It is a float between 0.0 and 2.0, where 0.0 gives the most deterministic responses. The default temperature is 1.0 (the default temperature of ChatGPT is 0.7).\n",
    "\n",
    "8. `n`: Specifies the number of completions (responses) to generate for each prompt. Useful for generating multiple responses to choose from.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. `top_p`: This is another parameter that influences the diversity of the model's responses, by limiting the model's choices to the most likely next tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds the value of top_p."
