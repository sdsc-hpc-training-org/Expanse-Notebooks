## Launching Jupyter Notebook 
To launch a Jupyter Notebook on Expanse we use the ```galyleo``` command as shown below:

1. Activate the Galyleo Shell Utility:
After logging into Expanse, you'll need to launch the galyleo shell utility to run Jupyter Notebook. Begin by adding the install location to your PATH environment variable using the following command

`export PATH="/cm/shared/apps/sdsc/galyleo:${PATH}"`

  After setting the path use the following command line to launch Galyleo:
 ```galyleo launch```

We need to use more command line options to launch Glayleo in the proper environemnt.

2. Launching Jupyter Notebook via Web Portal:
If you prefer using the web portal, Expanse provides a user-friendly interface where you can easily launch Jupyter Notebook without needing to modify environment variables or use the command line.

For more information about ```galyleo```, see Marty Kande's Galyleo Guidelines Repository [here](https://github.com/mkandes/galyleo?tab=readme-ov-file#command-line).

## Command-Line Options

When launching Jupyter Notebook on Expanse, it is essential to configure the environment according to your resource requirements, such as the number of CPUs, memory, and specific modules needed. Below are key command-line options that help customize the environment for your job:
- `--account`: Specify the account to be charged for the compute resources. You should use your assigned project account.
  
- `--partition`: Choose the resource partition for your job. The default partition is `shared`, but if you require GPU resources, use the `gpu-shared` partition.
  
- `--cpus`: Define the number of CPUs you want to allocate for the job.
  
- `--memory`: Specify the amount of memory(GB) want to use for the job. Specify the amount of memory (in GB) required for the job. Be sure to allocate sufficient memory for your notebook to avoid crashes or out-of-memory errors.
  
- `--time-limit`: Set a maximum time limit for the job in the format `HH:MM:SS`. For example, if your job is expected to run for 30 minutes, set this as `00:30:00`.
  
- `--env-modules`: Provide a comma-separated list of environment modules to load. These modules should include any necessary software or libraries required for your Jupyter notebook environment.
  
- `--sif`: Specify the path to a Singularity image file (container) in Expanse. For example, in Expanse, the Singularity container path could be `/cm/shared/apps/containers/singularity/`

Before submitting your job, make sure to account for Expanse system resources and current availability. You can check the Expanse system status and learn more about its resources by visiting SDSCâ€™s [Expanse User Guide](https://www.sdsc.edu/support/user_guides/expanse.html).

For additional information on command-line options, please refer to [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/mkandes/galyleo).

## Specifying the Environment
There are several ways to define the software environment, but here are the common methods to specify the environment for launching Jupyter Notebooks.

1.  Sigularity Container

Singularity is a tool used for running complex applications on High Performance Computing (HPC) systems. The Expanse system has several pre-installed containers, including libraries such as PyTorch, Tapis, and TensorFlow. You can view the installed containers by navigating to the following directory:
`/cm/shared/apps/containers/singularity`

When launching a Jupyter Notebook with Singularity, you need to use the `--sif` option to specify the container image. For example, if you want to use the TensorFlow library, you would include the `--sif` option followed by the path to the TensorFlow container:

 `-env-modules singularitypro --sif /cm/shared/apps/containers/singularity/tensorflow/tensorflow-latest.sif --bind /expanse,/scratch`

You may need to load the  `singularitypro ` module to use Singularity. Additionally, you should use the  `--bind ` command line option to mount files. For example, this command line bind option allows access to both the /expanse network filesystem and the local NVMe.


2. Create Conda Environment

Conda is an open-source software package, dependency, and environment management system created by Anaconda. It simplifies the installation of multiple packages for use in Jupyter notebooks on HPC systems. Galyleo supports both Anaconda and Miniconda (a minimal installer for Conda). You can create a custom Conda environment using a .yml file. We recommend that you use the example shown in the `Dataframe libraries example` described here: https://github.com/sbl-sdsc/df-parallel.

Below is an example of a `.yml` file:

```
name: df-parallel
 
channels:
  - conda-forge
  - anaconda

dependencies:
  - python=3.10
  - jupyterlab=4.0.1
  - ipywidgets=8.0.6
  - matplotlib=3.7.1
  - seaborn=0.12.2
  - papermill=2.3.4
  - dask=2023.3.2
  - pyspark=3.4.0
  - pyarrow=10.0.1
  - openjdk=17.0.3

variables:
  # SPARK conf directory with logging configuration
  SPARK_CONF_DIR: ../conf
  SPARK_DRIVER_MEMORY: 16G
  SPARK_DRIVER_MAXRESULTSIZE: 4G
  SPARK_WORKER_MEMORY: 4G
```
To launch the Jupyter notebook with this custom environment, use the following command:

```
galyleo launch --account abc123 --partition shared --cpus 4 --memory 8 --time-limit 00:30:00 --conda-env df-parallel
```
Here, the `--conda-env` option specifies the name of the Conda environment to activate when launching the Jupyter notebook on Expanse.
You can also specify the path to the `.yml` file using the `--conda-yml` option, like this:

`--conda-env df-parallel --conda-yml "${HOME}/df-parallel/environment.yml"`

Additionally, you can use options like `--mamba` and `--cache`. For more details on managing Conda environments, refer to the Galyleo [README](https://github.com/mkandes/galyleo?tab=readme-ov-file).


3. Andaconda

Anaconda is an open-source platform that includes over 300 packages for data science, machine learning, and scientific computing. Expanse supports the anaconda3/2021.05 version. You can find a full list of the packages included in this version [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/allpkglists/2021.05/).
To load the Anaconda environment on Expanse, you can use the following command:

`-env-modules cpu/0.17.3b,anaconda3/2021.05 `

## Modules
At the beginning of each of the Jupyter Notebooks in this collection you will find a list of necessary modules and packages that need to be imported to ensure that the notebook runs properly. Before running the notebook, check that your environment includes all the required modules.

For example, in the `numpy_intro.ipynb`, the list of moduels will look like this:

```
Required Modules for the Jupyter Notebook
Module: numpy, add, matplotlib, collections, Counter

Before running the notebook, we need to load the following modules.

import numpy as np
from operator import add
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import collections
from collections import Counter
```
Check that these modules are installed and available in the Jupyter environment. You can do this by defining the environment beforehand using command-line options.

## Configuring GPUs for galyleo

Unlike to portal, where the user envionment is set up automatically, the configuration GPUs needs to be set up using arguments passed to `galyleo` as shown below:


**Defining the Number of GPUs**
-`--gpus `:  Defines the number of GPUs to allocate for the job.

**Defining the Partition**

-`--partition`:  Specifies the partition to use, such as `gpu -shared`

For example, the following command launches a job with 2 GPUs, 16 GB of memory, and a time limit of 30 minutes:
`galyleo launch --account abc123 --partition gpu --gpus 2 --memory 16`

If you would like to learn more about the command-line options for configuring GPUs, please visit Marty Kande's Galyleo Guidelines Repository [here](https://github.com/mkandes/galyleo?tab=readme-ov-file#command-line).


**GPU Software Environment for Jupyter Notebooks**

1 Using environment modules

To load GPU and Anaconda3 environments using module commands:
`--env-modules`: Load the module `gpu/0.17.3b` and `anaconda3/2021.05`. This will ensure that GPU resources and necessary packages are available.

Example command:
 `galyleo launch --account abc123 --partition gpu --gpus 2 --memory 16 --time-limit 00:30:00 --env-modules gpu/0.17.3b,anaconda3/2021.05`

2 Singularity Contanier

You can also use a Singularity container with GPU resources. Specify the container image using the `--sif` option and load the necessary modules:
 `--env-modules singularitypro --sif /cm/shared/apps/containers/singularity/pytorch/pytorch-latest.sif --bind /expanse,/scratch`

3 Anaconda
To set up an Anaconda environment for GPU computing, please refer to the Peter Rose Repository for instructions on setting up a CONDA environment [here](https://github.com/sbl-sdsc/df-parallel).

The repository includes an `environment-gpu.yml` file, which installs cuDF and Dask-cuDF packages for running Jupyter Notebooks on GPU.

You can use the following command to specify the Conda environment:

`--conda-env df-parallel-gpu --conda-yml "${HOME}/df-parallel/environment-gpu.yml"`

## How to Check System Information and Installed Package Versions

After installing Jupyter Notebook, you might want to check the system information or verify the installed packages. This can be especially useful if you try to import a package and it doesn't work, and you need to check which packages are available in the current session.

### Watermark
Using the `watermark` extension, you can easily check system information and the versions of installed Python packages. 

To get started:
1. Install the `watermark` extension:

`pip install watermark`

2. Load the extension in your Jupyter Notebook:

`%load_ext watermark`

3. Use the `watermark` command to display the Python version and installed package information. In this example, you can check the versions of `ipywidgets, matplotlib, numpy, pandas, and sklearn` using the following command:

```
Python implementation: CPython
Python version       : 3.8.8
IPython version      : 7.22.0

ipywidgets: 7.6.3
matplotlib: 3.3.4
numpy     : 1.22.4
pandas    : 1.2.4
sklearn   : 0.24.1

Compiler    : GCC 7.3.0
OS          : Linux
Release     : 4.18.0-513.24.1.el8_9.x86_64
Machine     : x86_64
Processor   : x86_64
CPU cores   : 128
Architecture: 64bitIf you need to insall additioal packages you can try to install indvidially or pefer to lauch the juypternotebook again using the conda, conatiner.
```
If additional packages are required, you can:

Install them individually within the notebook using package managers like `pip` or `conda`.
Alternatively, relaunch the Jupyter Notebook environment using a Conda environment or a Singularity Container to include the necessary dependencies.

This ensures the proper setup of packages and an optimized environment for running your notebooks.
